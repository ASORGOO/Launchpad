<div class="essay_padding">“Boulevard of Broken Dreams” by Green Day. This song is about loneliness and being an outcast from society, being the only one out and having nobody around. This loneliness and alienation very much characterize Raskolnikov, who has been unable to connect well with people throughout the novel. His insistence on pushing people away, such as when he first meets Razumikhin and even his initial rejection of his sister due to her then planned marriage, means that he has very little emotional attachments to people and is often lonely and dispirited. This loneliness is shown in the first verse of the song, “I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don’t know where it goes, but it’s home to me and I walk alone.” The narrator conveys that he is often alone, as this lonely road is the only one he knows and because he calls it home. The phrase, “don’t know where it goes” signifies that he is lost in his world, he doesn’t really have a purpose, which is similar to Raskolnikov’s situation. Raskolnikov doesn’t really seem to have any big plans for his future. He simply prefers to live life on a day to day basis without really having any concrete goals for his future. Another line in the song also very much characterizes a major part of Raskolnikov. The line “I’m walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind,” suggests a duality in the character of the narrator. He has a division in his mind, perhaps a second character and he walks on the line that divides the two, meaning he likely often and suddenly shifts between the two. We have definitely seen this duality in Raskolnikov, for example when he finds the girl on the bench and one moment is determined to save her from a predator and then in an instance couldn’t care less about her fate. Raskolnikov also often switches between his desire to reveal that he is the murderer and his hope that his actions will remain a secret. Raskolnikov’s loneliness and duality have caused him great suffering and have driven him to madness. This song’s heavy and sad guitar riffs help enforce the sadness of the situation the narrator is in and it also hints at great suffering, a major theme in Crime and Punishment. “Until You Were Gone” by The Chainsmokers and Tritonal, featuring Emily Warren. This song very much reflects the later half of the Marmeladov subplot, from the point where Marmeladov dies, to the time when Katerina dies. The song is about not realizing how good someone was until it he or she is no longer there. In other words, it is about regret and how you feel after you have lost someone close to you. This song very much portrays how Katerina’s life progressed after Marmeladov dies. The line “ever since I left you … it keeps getting worse,” perfectly sums up Katerina’s downfall. One way to look at Marmeladov’s death is that Katrina left Marmeladov; she gave up on him and refused to forgive him. Even though she fussed over him in his final moments, she still kept saying that she would be better off without him and that and that he was only a burden. Even though in the song the person that the narrator left is still alive, she says that “the break was binding,” meaning that there is no chance of getting back together. The phrase “it keeps getting worse” tells the last part of Katerina’s story, where she spends nearly all the money given to her on Marmeladov’s memorial meal and is cast out of her home. She then frightens her own children as she forces them to dance and beg, showing how low she has gone. Finally, the line “I’m burning on the inside and the truth is that I didn’t know how good you were until you were gone,” tells the unspoken part of Katerina’s story. Even with Marmeladov’s drinking problem and instability, Katerina seemed to be doing alright. She was rational and caring towards the children. However, without Marmeladov, she has entered a hopeless state of mind. She gets temporary respite from Raskolnikov's donation but without Marmeladov she was destined to fall. Even though Katerina thought Marmeladov was a burden to her, she can’t seem to function without him, just like the song’s narrator, who is pained because she left a person that she can’t function without. “Battle Scars” by Lupe Fiasco and Guy Sebastian. The theme and suffering is very prevalent in Crime and Punishment, as Raskolnikov is constantly tormented by his actions and by other people. The song “Battle Scars” is about the scars you carry around from all the things that have been done to you. However, these are mental scars, not physical scars. The song talks about how traumatic events can have lingering effects on you that you never forget and they become your scars. Raskolnikov’s murder has left a big mental scar on him that we are constantly reminded of. Even though the song is mostly about the scars from a relationship, the effects of these scars on the person are similar to Raskolnikov’s feelings after committing a murder. For example, one of the lines from the song talks about the hurt that you feel from “The enemy within and all the fires from your friends.” The “enemy from within” is your own insecurity and madness, which Raskolnikov displays many times. There have been several instances where Raskolnikov’s inner dialog has got him worried or made him do irrational things. In general, after he has committed the murder, Raskolnikov is very jumpy and frightened whenever someone brings up anything to do with the murder. The people around Raskolnikov, his friends, seem to only be causing him more distress and suffering. Towards the end of the song, the narrator says “And I’m at the point of breaking, and it’s impossible to shake it,” meaning that all the emotional pain of his scars have pushed him to the tipping point and there is nothing that can stop him from going over. This is similar to the climax of Crime and Punishment, when Porfiry plainly tells Raskolnikov that he knows that Raskolnikov is the murderer and that he will soon arrest him. Raskolnikov has no response to this and seems to eventually accept the inevitability of his situation. He even tells Svidrigailov that he is not intimidated by his threat to go to the police and reveal Raskolnikov's secret because he knows that he has already lost. The overarching theme of this song is that people have hidden emotional scars that are not always apparent and that we need to be aware that they exist. Natural disasters are an inescapable part of this world. Tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes are a few of the countless natural disaster to affect the inhabitants of the earth. Earthquakes are one of these natural disasters that cause a lot of deaths and property damage throughout the United States. Hardly a month goes by without hearing about at least one major earthquake happening in somewhere in the world. Accounts of many deaths and hundreds of people injured and homeless usually accompany these stories of mass destruction. The larger earthquakes sometimes stimulate national efforts to aid those affected by these massive tremors. The sad news is that these earthquakes will keep coming and continually devastate every corner of the globe. Earthquakes have been a part of human history since the beginning of mankind. Earthquakes have sometimes become a major factor in the fall of ancient civilizations (“Earthquake,” Environmental Encyclopedia 2). Man’s quest to understand earthquakes began with the ancient Greeks, who believed that they were caused by underground winds. Over the past couple thousand years we have increased our knowledge exponentially, especially with the invention of the modern seismograph in the 1900’s (“Earthquake,” Encyclopedia 1). Nevertheless, every year earthquakes devastate many countries around the world, causing many deaths and costing the governments that are affected millions and sometimes billions of dollars in damage. One of the most famous earthquakes to hit the United States was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. This devastating earthquake hit on April 4, 1906 and caused about 3000 deaths, thousands of injuries, and about half a billion dollars of damage (“Earthquake,” Environmental Encyclopedia 2). A more recent earthquake to hit California was the 2010 Baja California earthquake. It was the strongest earthquake to hit California after several years of relatively small seismic activity and it was felt by many people living in the southwestern portion of the United States. The earthquake was so powerful that it actually moved the Mexican city of Calexico two and a half feet to the south (3). The most powerful earthquake ever recorded measured a 9.5 on the Richter scale. It struck Chile on May 22, 1960 and caused 2000 deaths and more than half a billion dollars in damage. The resulting tsunami claimed lives all along the Western American coastline and caused damage as far away as Japan (3). There are indications in the past decade that human activities have affected seismic activity. Recent studies highlight the reality of man-made earthquakes, also known as induced earthquakes. A study done by the US Geological Survey (USGS) found that the amount of yearly earthquakes in the united state of magnitude 3 or greater has tripled since the turn of the century.  Most of the earthquakes were found to be linked with an increased amount wastewater injection into the earth. Even though these earthquakes were small and barely felt, there is the possibility that wastewater injection has caused much more powerful earthquakes that have resulted in some damage to homes (“Induced Earthquakes” 1). There has also been some evidence to suggest that the severity of earthquakes caused by wastewater injection increases the more water is pumped and the faster it is pumped. The USGS does however say that these findings require more research to produce more convincing conclusions (2). There are several proposed and significantly researched techniques that could be implemented in a short period of time to reduce the damage caused by earthquakes, the first of which is early-warning systems. Different from predicting earthquakes, this method detects earthquakes that have already happened and warns people that haven’t felt them yet that heavy shaking is imminent. Beta examples of these systems are already operational in places like Caltech, where in March of 2013, their systems told them that they would experience the shaking of a magnitude 5.2 earthquake over half a minute before it happened (Nagourney 1). These systems work one of two ways. When a tectonic plate snaps back into place, it sends out two kinds of waves: primary and secondary waves. Primary waves are the faster of the two and barely cause any damage. The secondary waves are the ones responsible for all of the shaking felt during an earthquake. An early warning system would detect the faster primary waves and send out alerts that the secondary waves are on their way. The other way they could work is by having sensors close to the center of an earthquake and broadcast alert signals that would travel faster than the secondary waves (Normile 1). These systems are already in place in parts of Mexico and Japan. In Mexico it is intended to give their capital city over a minute of warning if a large earthquake struck along their Pacific Coast. In Japan, it is currently used to stop their bullet trains if a large earthquake is imminent and warn people on the highways to slow down (2). It is estimated that a modern system for California would cost around $100 million to develop and set up (Matheny 1). Currently in California the cost is a big problem and public awareness is necessary to raise the amount required (Nagourney 1). A cheaper solution for the government would be to get people earthquake insurance if they live in earthquake prone areas. If more people had earthquake insurance in general, the government would have less to worry about in terms of disaster relief money. A proposed solution in the Philippines is the Earthquake Protection Insurance Co. (EPIC), which would offer more people earthquake insurance without seriously affecting the insurance industry. The Philippines is especially vulnerable to financial trouble after a natural disaster. It is estimated that it costs the Philippines about $2.57 dollars to deal with flood damage annually. It is also estimated that a large earthquake could take about $114 billion dollars to recover from, or about one-third of the Philippines GDP. That is a significant amount of money that the Philippine government would have a hard time recovering from. However, in order for EPIC to successfully reduce the financial burden of an earthquake it will have to be mandatory for all people so that everyone is covered (Torres 1). A similar strategy is being implemented for a different kind of natural disaster; floods. In Connecticut, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has released new flood mapping which puts many people living along the coast in high-risk flood zones (Spiegel 1). This new mapping in combination with Obama’s National Flood Insurance Program would significantly drive up the price of homes in flood zones. One person reported that if he had to pay $5000 for insurance, which one of his friends currently is, he would rather move than stay (2). If this same strategy were implemented for earthquakes, the cost of living in earthquake prone areas would most likely provoke many people to move out of earthquake areas, lessening the loss of life. Additionally, homes damaged by earthquakes that were insured would relieve the government of having to pay for disaster relief and keep the affected nation’s infrastructure stable. A third way to reduce the damage of an earthquake would be to construct buildings that will not break and topple during earthquakes. Japan is considered to have some of the toughest buildings on the planet, implementing the latest technology and strict codes to keep even skyscrapers standing during powerful earthquakes. Unlike the United States, the Japanese building codes are much more specific on how a building must be engineered. After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, Japan spent large amounts of money researching and developing the best ways to make buildings more resistant to the intense ground shaking that occurs during earthquakes. Another method that Japan employs is strengthening older buildings that were not built with the current building codes and are most likely to be destroyed during major earthquakes (Glanz and Onishi 1). After assessing the damage to the Kobe earthquake it was found that the majority of the buildings that fell were those that were built before the major changes to the building codes in 1971 and 1981 (Normile and Kerr 1-2). Many current earthquake resistant buildings include several modern apparatuses to reduce the swaying of the building and the amount of force put on a building from the energy of the earthquake. One of those devices that are being used in Japanese buildings are isolation pads. These rubber pads are placed at the bottom of a building’s structure and cause the building to experience less shaking during an earthquake. Some buildings also use energy dissipation units, which are built into the skeleton of a building. These objects expand and contract to counteract the shaking caused by an earthquake and decrease the overall swaying of a building (Glanz and Onishi 1). After an earthquake hit Chile in early 2010, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute of California sent many people to gather data on how Chile’s buildings performed in the earthquake (Nelsen 1). Chile shares similar building codes and materials with the United States and this gave researchers an opportunity to study how California’s buildings would have fared in a similar earthquake. They found that they were doing many things right with the current building codes but also found some faults and places for improvement (2). Of the three proposed solutions, strong building codes are the most effective method for reducing the damage of earthquakes. The flaws of the other two solutions outweigh the flaws of the building codes solution. Building codes protect people against earthquakes no matter where they hit. Early warning systems only work if the origin of the earthquake is far enough away. If a fault line runs right under a city and it is the source of a large earthquake, an early warning system won’t do the city much good. Stronger buildings would be the critical factor in reducing damage during the earthquake and saving lives. Of course if the earthquake were far enough away, anyone would want a minute to prepare for the massive shaking that was about to happen. Earthquake insurance would also only work to reduce property damage during an earthquake if people moved out of those areas due to the high prices. Earthquake insurance would only reduce financial damage if a large earthquake were to hit a highly populated area. This would be more important in countries with weaker economies than the United States but it could still help relieve some financial burdens for the United States if a large earthquake hit. Strong building codes would be the best way to save the government millions of dollars in property damage because if buildings are stronger, there is less property damage. There are some drawbacks to the building codes. For one it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that a building will not collapse during any earthquake. There could be an earthquake in the future with a magnitude that exceeds the standards buildings were designed for. Also, older buildings not built to the current codes still need to be reinforced to allow them to stay standing during powerful earthquakes. Despite the drawbacks, the implemented building codes have shown some of the best results in saving structures and lives during earthquakes. Compared to the other three solutions, building codes have proven themselves the most reliable and have shown their worth over and over again. Imagine living in a big city and all of the skyscrapers were to collapse. Imagine all of the lives that would be lost. The current building codes being implemented around the world in earthquake hot spots have allowed many skyscrapers to survive countless earthquakes and save many lives. There has also been a visible contrast between the countries that strictly enforce their building codes and those that don’t. In China the consequences of not constructing buildings according to code was very evident when the Sichuan Earthquake struck it in 2008. So many people were killed that would have survived if the buildings had been built correctly (Glanz 2). Another smaller benefit that can come from having a home or office built to the highest standard is the ability to attract people to buy or work at that place with a guarantee that they will be safer there during an earthquake than in other places built to a lower standard. There is a strong need to act now to make sure we can be as safe as possible during future earthquakes. If this problem reaches a crisis point there is no telling what kind of damage it will result in. It is unsure if the world would recover if earthquakes started erupting all around the earth in high frequencies. Earthquakes have wiped out civilizations in the past and there is no doubt that very powerful earthquakes could cause the modern world to suffer the same fate. There is almost no doubt that we have not seen the last of this horrible natural disaster. Earthquakes will almost certainly be a part of the future of the United States causing deaths and destruction. as a nation we need to be prepared for the worst.</div>
